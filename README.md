# C Simulation of Two Vortices Interaction in Basilisk

## Overview

This simulation models the interaction between two vortices using the Basilisk computational framework, which is designed for solving fluid dynamics problems. The simulation demonstrates the dynamics of vortex interactions within a two-dimensional flow field, using a vortex method approach. The primary objective is to examine the influence of initial conditions on vortex evolution and interaction, and observe the resulting flow behaviour.

## Requirements

- **Basilisk**: A fluid dynamics framework for 2D/3D simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The framework must be installed and set up before running this simulation. For installation instructions, refer to the [Basilisk documentation](https://basilisk.fr).
- **C Compiler**: A C compiler (e.g., GCC) is required to compile the simulation code.

## Simulation Description

In this simulation, two point vortices are initialised in a two-dimensional domain. The vortices are defined by their positions and strengths, and their motion is governed by the Biot–Savart law, which is used to model the velocity field of the vortices. The interaction between the vortices is simulated over time, showing how they influence each other.

### Key Parameters

- **Vortex Strength** (`Γ`): The circulation of each vortex.
- **Vortex Position** (`(x, y)`): Initial positions of the vortices in the domain.
- **Domain Size** (`L`): The size of the computational domain.
- **Time Step** (`dt`): The time increment between each simulation step.
- **Total Simulation Time** (`T`): The duration for which the simulation will run.

### Physics Model

The velocity induced by a single vortex at a point in space is given by the Biot–Savart law. The interaction of two vortices is calculated by summing the velocity fields generated by each vortex at every time step. This interaction leads to the movement and deformation of the vortices, which is tracked throughout the simulation.

## Compilation and Execution

### Step 1: Install Basilisk

Follow the instructions on the Basilisk website to install the framework.

### Step 2: Compile the Code

Once the code is written and placed in a `.c` file, compile it using a C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -o vortex_simulation vortex_simulation.c -lbasilisk -lm
```

This will compile the C code and link it to the Basilisk library (`-lbasilisk`) and the math library (`-lm`).

### Step 3: Run the Simulation

Run the compiled simulation using:

```bash
./vortex_simulation
```

The program will output the results, such as vortex positions over time, to the terminal or to a file, depending on the implementation.

## Output

- The primary output is a visualisation of the vortices over time.
- Additionally, data such as vortex positions and velocities can be output to a file for further analysis.

## Code Structure

- **`vortex_simulation.c`**: The main C code file containing the simulation logic.
- **`parameters.h`**: Header file containing simulation parameters such as vortex strength, initial positions, and time step.
- **`biot_savart.c`**: Function file containing the implementation of the Biot-Savart law for vortex interaction.

### Example: Vortex Interaction Logic

```c
// Biot-Savart law implementation
void biot_savart(double x, double y, double gamma, double* vx, double* vy) {
    double r2 = x*x + y*y;
    double r = sqrt(r2);
    *vx = -gamma * y / (2 * M_PI * r2);
    *vy = gamma * x / (2 * M_PI * r2);
}
```

## Notes

- The accuracy of the simulation depends on the chosen time step (`dt`). Smaller time steps provide more accurate results but require more computation.
- The interaction between vortices can lead to phenomena such as vortex shedding, fusion, or a more complex flow structure.

## Limitations

- The current implementation does not include boundary effects, which can be relevant in confined geometries.
- The model assumes inviscid flow, neglecting the effects of viscosity and friction.

## Further Development

- **Inclusion of boundaries**: Implement periodic or reflective boundary conditions to simulate more realistic environments.
- **3D Extension**: Extend the model to three dimensions for a more comprehensive analysis of vortex dynamics in three-dimensional flows.
- **Turbulence Modelling**: Investigate the potential inclusion of turbulence models or higher-order methods for more complex simulations.
